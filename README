Dot Net Translator
======================

This solution provides a method to easily convert .NET source code from VB to C#.


How to use?
-------------
With visual studio 2012 or higher, load solution file and hit build solution. 

The generated executable can be used as follows:

DotNetTranslator.exe path/to/vb/file path/to/output/file


How is this accomplished?
--------------------------
This solution takes advantage of Microsoft's new compiler technology, Roslyn, to parse VB source code into an AST, convert it to a C# AST, and then emit the C# equivalent of the program.

Issues
--------------------------
This translator currently chokes on translating the VB event behavior found with generated VB code. In addition, it skips over the "With" blocks, there will be comments on any code that failed to emit.

Maybe, I'll fix this in the future, the manual conversion is relatively simple.

Due Credit
---------------------------
This solution extends the behavior of the demo application provided by Roslyn CTP. The Roslyn team provided a handy feature of pasting VB to C# and visa versa, depending on the target source. I needed a way to script converting source files, this solution provides that.

Disclaimer
-------------------
I can write VB, but I enjoy writing C# more. I feel more expressive with it,and something about lambdas in VB turns me off. The console application provided with this code is configured to only convert VB to C#. 

I currently have no intention to improve this, and sunk less than 30 minutes into it. Feel free to improve it, just give credit to where it is due.
